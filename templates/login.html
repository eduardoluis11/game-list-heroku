        <!-- Turns out that I canâ€™t simply send the form via Jinja notation to make the form appear in sign_up.html: I
        need to first type the <form> tags in the Sign Up page, and add it its respective CSRF token. Then, inside that
        <form> tag, I will call the form using Jinja notation.

        I could use the "form.field_name" and "form.field_name.label_tag" notation in Jinja to get the name and the
        label for that field separately. That way, I could add <br> tags to properly style the form (source:
        Charlesthk's and John C's answers from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5827590/css-styling-in-django-forms
        .)

        In the end, I ended up creating a regular form. That's because a regular form can hide passwords, Django's
        forms can't (as far as I know.)

        I had to change the url from "login" to "login_user", since I changed the name of the view() function,
        and I was getting bugs because of it.-->
        <form action="{% url 'login_user' %}" method="post">
            {% csrf_token %}

            <div class="form-group">
                <input class="form-control" autofocus type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username">
            </div>

            <br>

            <div class="form-group">
                <input class="form-control" type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password">
            </div>

            <br>
            <input class="btn btn-primary" type="submit" value="Login">
        </form>
        <br>
